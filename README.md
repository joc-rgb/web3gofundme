## About
There are many crowdfunding platform for web3 projects to get funding. However, I think Non-profit organization and charity need more attention compared to for-profit web3 projects. Thus, I built this, a decentralized Web3 GoFundMe. This project is built to support **non-profit charity** fundraising ONLY.

## How I built it

Next.JS React framework

### Backend
